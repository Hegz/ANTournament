A list of requirements for a Tournamanet app as sugested by from u/dodgepong on reddit

New tournamant rules have come out in since this post, but it's a good starting place

Here is my list of requirements for a tournament app:
 * Enter players with the following information:
  * Name
  * Corp/Runner ID
  * Paid
  * Nickname (optional)
 * Be able to view a complete list of players + ID pairs
 * Support Swiss format
  * Automatic pairings such that people don't play each other more than once
  * Show IDs with players when displaying pairings
  * Easy manual re-pairing
  * Support mid-tournament player additions
  * TOME-style Strength of Schedule (see latest tournament rules)
  * View list of current rankings at any point, including prestige and SoS
  * Easily record matches as "Sweep", "Corp Split", "Runner Split", as well as timed wins/ties
 * Support double elimination with automatic seeding from a Swiss tournament
 * Fullscreen round timer
  * Post-tournament stats breakdown
  * Number/percentage of each ID/faction
  * Side win rates (runner vs. corp)
  * Faction vs. faction win rates
  * Number of sweeps vs. splits
  * Top X ID breakdown

Nice to have:
 * Upload tournament results to Acoo.net
 * Synchronize with an online bracket system like Challonge.com
 * Have some way for players (and spectators) to get pairings/standings on their phones or online
 * Synchronize available IDs with NetrunnerDB
